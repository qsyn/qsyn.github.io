Quantitative Feedback Theory (QFT) is a frequency domain robust control design technique, introduced by Isaac Horowitz . If you were looking for Quantum Field Theory you are in the wrong place! Open Qsyn is a Matlab based, object oriented, free open source toolbox to aid QFT control synthesis. It replaces the obsolete Qsyn toolbox developed by Per-Olof Gutman and co-workers in the 90s. The development is supported by Prof. Gutman himself, and all reused code is done with his premission. How to use Installation Download and unzip the recent version (or fork the repo ) into a new folder named <folderName> Add <folderName> to your Matlab path Run oqsyn_ini to initiate the toolbox Demo A quick introductory example is provided by the live script exmaple.mlx . This exmaple will guide you through the steps of SISO design: definning a new plant and design specifications, computaing templates and bounds, designing a feedback compensator and a pre-filter. Documentation Open Qsyn uses Matlab based documentation, thus viewd using standard Matlab help and doc commands. General documentation is accsessed by typing help <folderName> , with <folderName> Open Qsyn installation folder. Documentation for a functions is viewd by typing help <functionName> . Documentation for a class is viewed by typing help <className> . Documentation for a method is viewed by typing help <className/methodName> . Status Open Qsyn toolbox is under construction, but it can already be used for SISO QFT design for plants with parametric uncertainty, unstructuerd uncertainty, and uncertain delay. Feel free to open issues in order to report bugs or suggests new features. Just check the GitHub issues section first :). The toolbox is regulary tested on Matlab 2015b,2017a,2017b. For complete functionality the Control Systems Toolbox is required.
